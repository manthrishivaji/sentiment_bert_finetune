### Note : I did fine tune on notebook and pushed to HF-hub.For project I downloaded the model from hub.

- Clone the repo
- Install required libraries in respective backend and frontend folders
- Go to backend folder file named "model.py" and run it it will create a folder "model" and save the model init.
- To verify if everything is working fine , in frontend/gradio.py for api_url modify it accordingly.Dont use backend:predict/ it wont work, use 127.0.0.1/predict or acoordingly.
